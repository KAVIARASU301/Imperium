Let's add a new feature "Stacker", if after entering a positions  and market moves in favor of certain points whatever user fixes (say 20) in the UI, add one more position (stacking over the old one), if market moves more 20 points add one more, keep stacking for every  if the exit of the first taken position triggers, exit all this stacked position, add this in the setup panel, user can set points and enable or disable this feature, no need to care about stacking same positions (strikes) of old or not, just send the signal, buy exit panel will take care the strikes, sometimes same position may be stacked, some times may not, it is not a problem, but the first taken positions exit, triggers exit for all the stacked positions, make simulator also uses this stacking property,
