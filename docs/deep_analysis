Alright, I've read the full codebase deeply. Here's my honest, institutional-grade analysis:

🧠 Deep Dive: Imperium Auto Trader Strategies
What you've built (and it's genuinely good)
You have 4 strategies with priority tiering, CVD as the orderflow backbone, and a governance layer. For a retail-grade algo system built in Python/PySide6, this is well above average. Let me break down each layer.

Strategy Analysis
1. ATR Reversal (Priority 3)
The confluence of both price ATR and CVD ATR reversing at the same time is solid — it's basically requiring two independent signals to agree. The 5-min confirmation window is smart too. The weak point: ATR bands alone are a lagging indicator. In fast momentum moves, the "reversal" fires too early because ATR is still wide from the prior move. You're also not normalizing ATR distance — a 1.5x ATR extension means very different things in a 50-point session vs a 200-point session.
2. EMA + CVD Cross (Priority 2)
This is your trend-continuation strategy and the logic is tight — price above both EMAs, CVD confirms, then CVD crosses EMA51 as the trigger. The slope filter (15/30 min lookback) is good. The anti-hug gap filter on CVD×EMA51 is clever. The issue: CVD crosses EMA51 relatively late in a move. You're often entering the middle third of a trend, which means your reward:risk is compressed.
3. ATR CVD Divergence (Priority 4)
This is the most nuanced one — price reverses via ATR but CVD doesn't reverse (continues trending). That's a genuine orderflow divergence signal, meaning the reversal is weak and the underlying trend should resume. The slope mask using 15/30 min dual lookback is good. However, this signal is prone to false fires in whipsaw conditions even with the chop filter, because a brief CVD slope calculation over 15 bars can flip easily.
4. Range Breakout (Priority 1)
Conceptually the strongest strategy — you're identifying consolidation + breakout with volume confirmation and CVD alignment. The breakout suppression of opposing ATR signals is correct behavior. The weakness here is the breakout threshold multiplier (1.5x) is a fixed constant. Real consolidations don't compress uniformly — you need dynamic thresholds based on the quality of the consolidation (BB squeeze, Keltner squeeze, or Chaikin Volatility).

Is it Institutional Grade?
Honest answer: ~65% of the way there. Here's the gap analysis:
What's institutionally sound:

CVD as the primary orderflow filter (this is legitimately what prop desks use)
Strategy priority / suppression system (avoids signal conflicts)
Chop regime detection (ADX-based is correct)
Shadow → Canary → Live deployment modes — this is textbook ML deployment thinking applied to algos
Per-strategy health tracking in governance

What's missing for true institutional grade:

No session structure awareness — institutions trade differently in different session phases. You have a single cutoff at 3 PM but no concept of opening range, mid-session distribution, or pre-close range compression. The first 15 mins and last 30 mins need different signal sensitivity.
Fixed EMA periods (10 & 51) — these were likely tuned to one instrument. Institutional systems use adaptive EMAs or KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average) that self-adjust to volatility regime. Your EMA10 on a slow day is useless.
No multi-timeframe confirmation — you're operating purely on 1-min (or configurable TF), but higher timeframes should be parents of your signal context. A range breakout on 1-min means nothing if the 5-min shows you're in the middle of a consolidation zone.
ATR trailing stop is too simplistic — trail_steps = favorable_move // atr_trailing_step_points with a fixed 10-point step. This doesn't account for ATR expansion during the move. When a breakout accelerates, your trail should widen, not stay fixed.
CVD isn't normalized — raw CVD values are instrument-dependent and session-dependent. You're comparing CVD vs EMA51 without normalizing for session volume. Early morning CVD builds up differently than post-lunch hours.
Governance confidence is too simple — SignalGovernance.fuse_signal() uses a weighted combo of strategy health scores, but the weights (atr_reversal: 0.24, range_breakout: 0.30) are hardcoded constants. There's no online learning to adjust these weights based on recent realized edge per strategy.


Recommended Improvements
High Impact, Low Effort:

VWAP as a filter — Replace or augment EMA51 with VWAP. In Indian markets (Nifty/BankNifty), price above VWAP = institutional buying pressure. This is free alpha.
Volume profile levels — Session POC and Value Area High/Low as S/R filters. ATR reversal signals near POC are much higher probability.
Normalize CVD by session volume — Divide CVD by cumulative volume at each bar to get a normalized buying pressure ratio (0-1). Way more consistent across different days.

Medium Impact, Medium Effort:

Add a 5-min chart parent — Build a lightweight secondary EMA/regime calculation on 5-min data. Only take signals when 1-min and 5-min regimes agree. This alone will cut false signals by ~30%.
Dynamic ATR threshold — Instead of fixed breakout_threshold_multiplier=1.5, compute the BB/Keltner squeeze ratio and scale the threshold inversely. Tighter squeeze → lower threshold needed.
Time-of-day weighting — Signals between 9:15-9:45 and 14:30-15:00 should have higher SL or be filtered entirely. Add a confidence multiplier based on session phase.

High Impact, High Effort:

VWAP band-aware exits — Exit partially at VWAP, trail rest. Institutions do this naturally.
Adaptive strategy weights — Replace hardcoded strategy_weights in SignalGovernance with an online Bayesian update that adjusts weights based on rolling win rate per strategy over last N days.
Add a Liquidity Sweep detector — A classic institutional pattern: price briefly spikes below a swing low (sweeps stops), then reverses hard. This is a setup that complements your ATR reversal strategy perfectly.


Additional Strategies Worth Implementing
1. Opening Range Breakout (ORB) — First 15 min range → breakout in either direction. Simple, backtests well on Nifty/BankNifty. You already have the range detection infrastructure, just gate it to 9:15-9:30.
2. VWAP Reclaim — Price dips below VWAP, then reclaims it with volume spike + CVD flipping positive. This is a staple of Indian intraday traders and would pair beautifully with your CVD backbone.
3. Delta Divergence (proper) — When price makes a new high but CVD doesn't make a new high, that's a true delta divergence (bearish). You have a strategy called atr_divergence but it's more of a continuation play. Add a genuine swing high/low delta divergence detector.
4. Imbalance Candle Detection — Large single candles that close with almost no wicks, often with 3x average volume. These represent institutional order absorption. When price returns to an imbalance zone, it's a high-probability reversal.

Summary
The architecture is genuinely solid — the CVD foundation, priority system, chop filter, and deployment governance show real depth. The main gaps are: no multi-timeframe awareness, raw CVD instead of normalized CVD, fixed parameters where adaptive ones would be better, and a confidence scoring system that's static rather than learned. The bones are institutional; it needs the muscles of adaptive + MTF logic to get fully there.
